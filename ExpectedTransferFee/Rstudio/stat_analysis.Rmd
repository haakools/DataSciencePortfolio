## Analysing Age Decay




```{r}

df <- read.csv("transfer_data.csv")
age_transfer <- subset(df, age == 32)


x <- age_transfer$fee_infladj/max(age_transfer$fee_infladj)

qqnorm(x, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
qqline(x, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)


plotdist(x, histo = TRUE, demp = TRUE)


```


```{r}
descdist(x, discrete=FALSE, boot=50)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
